## Introduction


### What is Backend Development?

Backend development refers to the sever-side of web development, where the primary focus is on managing the logic, databases, and APIs that power web applications. It encompasses tasks such as user authentication, authorization, and handling requests, typically using languages like Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, JavaScripts(Node.js), or .NET. The goal of backend development is to ensure smooth data flow and communication between the server, database, and frontend.

### What Does a Backend Developer Do?

A backend developer is responsible for building and maintaining the sever-side architecture of web applications. This involves creating and managing APIs, handling database interactions, and ensuring that the backend can handle high traffic loads efficiently. Their duties also include integrating external services like payment systems or cloud platforms, while continuously improving performance and scalability. Backend developers paly a critical role in securing and processing data, serving as the backbone that support front teams in delivering seamless, responsive user experiences.

## Frontend

Although my goal is to become a backend developer, mastering basic frontend knowledge is essential for serval reason. While backend developers primarily focus on sever-side logic, databases, and APIs, understanding the fronted is crucial for ensuring seamless integration between the client and server.

### What is Frontend Development?

Frontend development is the client-side aspect of web development, responsible for everything users see and interact with on a website or web application. It involves the use of technologies like: HTML(Hypertext Markup Language), CSS(Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

## Internet Technology

### Internet Concepts and Terminology

- **Packet**: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
- **Router**: A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
- **IP Address**: a unique identifier. IPv4 and IPv6.
  - ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
  - 192.168.1.1, 127.0.0.1 
- **Domain Name**: a human-readable name to identify a website.
- **DNS**: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain name to IP address.
- **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.
  - **Ports**: A unique port number to ensure data to be sent to the correct destination.
  - **Sockets**: A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication.
  - **Connections**: A connection is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other. During the process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the "maximum segment size" and "window size", which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.
  - **Data transfer**: Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.

- **HTTP**: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS encryption.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security. These protocols are used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet. Commonly used to provide secure connections for applications such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
  - **Certificates**: Establish trust between the client and server.
  - **Handshake**: The client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for secure connection.
  - **Encryption**: Data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.

- **The Future**: Emerging Trends and Technologies
  - **5G/6G**: new mobile network technology, offering faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity than previous generations.
  - **IoT**: Internet of Things. The Network of physical device, vehicles, home appliances, and other objects that are connect to the internet and can exchange data.
  - **AI**: Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning and natural language processing, and it has been widely used in healthcare, finance, education, and voice assistants.
  - **Blockchain**: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, decentralized transactions. 
  - **Edge computing**: Processing and storage of data at the edge of the network, rather than in centralized data center.

### Hosting


### DNS

### Browser


## Computer Science


## Program Language

### Python

### Django

## Version Control System

### Git

### GitHub

## Data Structure & Algorithms

## Databases

### Relational

- Data is stored in tables with rows & columns
- Best for apps that require complex queries & transactions
- Banking systems, E-commerce apps
- Apps that require complex reporting
- Most popular: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
 
### Non-Relational

- Data is stored without a predefined table structure
- Best for apps that require flexible data models & real-time analytics
- Most popular: MongoDB

### SQL

### PostgreSQL

### MySQL


## Design Patterns

- Proven solutions to common design problems.

- There are 23 classic design patterns: 1. Strategy 2. Decorator 3. Factory Method 4. Observer 5. Chain of Responsibility 6. Singleton 7. Flyweight 8. Adapter 9. Facade 10. Template 11. Builder 12. Iterator 13. Composite 14. Command 15. Mediator 16. State 17. Proxy 18. Abstract Factory 19. Bridge 20. Interpreter 21. Memento 22. Prototype 23 Visitor.

- Helps us understand object-oriented design principles & web frameworks.
