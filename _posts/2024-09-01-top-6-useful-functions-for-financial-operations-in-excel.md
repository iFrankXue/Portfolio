## **Introduction**


## **Functions**

### 1. PV

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **PV**      | Calculates the present value of a loan or an investment, based on a <br />constant interest rate.       | =PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])      |

The `PV()` function in Excel is used to calculate the **Present Value** of an investment or loan. Present Value is the current worth of a sum of money that is expected to be received or paid in the future, discounted at a specific interest rate. This function is particularly useful in finance for evaluating the value of future cash flows in today's terms. 

**Syntax**: `=PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])`.

**Parameters**:
  - `rate`: The interest rate per period. This is typically the annual interest rate divided by the number of periods per year.
  - `nper`: The total number of payment periods in the investment or loan.
  - `pmt`: The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the investment or loan. Typically, `pmt` includes principal and interest but excludes taxes and fees.
  - `fv`(*optional*): The future value of a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If omitted, it defaults to 0, meaning the future value of the investment is 0.
  - `type`(*optional*): When payments are due. `0` indicates payments are due at the end of the period, and `1` indicates payments are due at the beginning. If omitted, it defaults to 0.

**Example**: Suppose you want to calculate the present value of an investment that promises to pay $1,000 per year for 5 years, with an interest rate of 5% pre year, and you make the first payment at the end of the year. 

```
=PV(5%/1, 5, -1000)
```

  - `rate`: 5% per year, but since payment are annual, no need to divide further.
  - `nper`: 5 periods (years).
  - `pmt`: -1000 (negative because it represents outgoing payments).

**Key Points**:

  - The `PV()` function will return the present value of these cash flows, indicating how much the future payments are worth in today's dollars. 
  - The **Present Value** is a critical concept in finance, helping determine how much a series of future payments is worth right now. The `rate` and `nper` must be consistent in terms of the time period used (e.g., both annually, monthly, etc.). 
  - Always input payments(pmt) as negative values if they represent outflows (money you're paying out).

This function is particularly useful when assessing loans, mortgages, or any investment where understanding the value of future payments in today's terms is essential.

### 2. FV

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **FV**      | Calculates the future value of a an investment based on a constant <br />interest rate.           | =FV(rate,nper,pmt,[pv],[type])     |

The `FV()` function in Excel is used to calculate the **Future Value** of an investment or loan based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. The Future Value represents the amount of money an investment will grow to over a specified period, assuming a certain interest rate.

**Syntax**: `=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])`

**Parameters**:
  
  - `rate`: The interest rate per period. This is usually the annual interest rate divided by the number of periods per year.
  - `nper`: The total number of payment periods in the investment or loan.
  - `pmt`: The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the investment or loan. Typically, `pmt` includes principal and interest but excludes taxes and fees.
  - `pv`(*optional*): The present value, or the lump sum amount that a series of future payments is worth right now. If omitted, it defaults to 0, meaning there's no initial lump sum investment.
  - `type`(*optional*): When payments are due. `0` indicates payments are due at the end of the period, and `1` indicates payments are due ate the beginning. If omitted, it defaults to 0.

**Example**: Suppose you want to calculate the future value of an investment where you deposit $200 per month for 5 years into an account that earns an annual interest rate of 6% (compounded monthly).

```
 =FV(6%/12, 5*12, -200)
 ```

  - `rate`: 6% annual interest rate divided by 12 to get the monthly rate.
  - `nper`: 5 years multiplied by 12 to get the total number of monthly periods (60 months).
  - `pmt`: -200 (negative because it represents outgoing payments).

  The `FV()` function wil return the future value of these cash flows, which indicates how much the investment will be worth after 5 years.

**Key Points**:

  - The `Future Value` is essential for understanding how much an investment will grow over time.
  - The `rate` and `nper` need to consistent in terms of the time period used (e.g., both monthly, annually, etc.).
  - Payments (pmt) are typically input as negative values if they represent outflows (money you're paying into the investment).

This function is particularly useful when planning savings, retirement funds, or any situation where you need to predict how much an investment will be worth in the future.


### 3. NPV

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **NPV**     | Calculates the net present value of a investment by using a discount <br />rate and a series of future payments (negative values) and income <br />(positive values).     | =NPV(rate,value1,[value2],...)       |

The `NPV()` function in Excel is used to calculate **Net Present Value** of an investment based on a series of period cash flows and a discount rate. The Net Present Value represents the difference between the present value of cash flows and outflows over a period of time. It's a key metric in financial analysis for assessing the profitability of an investment.

**Syntax**: `NPV(rate, value1, [value2], ...)`

**Parameters**:

  - `rate`: The discount rate or the rate of return that could be earned on an investment in the financial markets with similar risk. This rate is used to discount future cash flows to the present value.
  - `value1`, `value2`, ...: These are the cash flows that occur at the end of each period. They can be positive (inflows) or negative (outflows). You can enter up to 254 value arguments in Excel.

**Example**: Suppose you're evaluating an investment that requires an initial outlay of $10,000 and is expected to generate cash inflows of $3,000 at the end of each year for 5 year. If your required rate of return is 8%, you can calculate the NPV as follows:

```
=NPV(8%, 3000, 3000, 3000, 3000, 3000) - 10000
```

  - `rate`: 8% is the discount rate.
  - `value1`, `value2`, ...: $3,000 is the expected cas inflow at the end of each year for 5 years.
  - The subtraction of $10,000 at the end adjust for the initial investment cost, which is not included in the `NPV()` function's cash flows (since they are assumed to be future cash flows).

The `NPV()` function calculates the present value of the future cash flows and then you subtract the initial investment to get the net present value. A positive NPV indicates that the investment is expected to generate more cash than the cost, making it a potentially profitable investment.

**Key Points**:
  - **Net Present Value(NPV)** helps determine the profitability of an investment by considering the time value of money.
  - If the **NPV** is positive, the investment is generally considered good because it's expected to generate more value than its cost.
  - The `rate` should reflect the required return or the cost of capital, which varies depending on the investment's risk.

The `NPV()` function is widely used in capital budgeting to evaluate the viability of projects, investments, or any financial decision involving future cash flows.

### 4. RATE

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **RATE**    | Returns the interest rate per period of an annuity.     | =RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], <br />[guess]) |

The `rate()` function in Excel is used to calculate the interest rate per period of an annuity. This function is particularly useful when you want to determine the rate of the interest for a loan or investment when the number of periods, payment amount, and present or future value are know.

**Syntax**:

```
RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
```

**Parameters**:

  - `nper`: The total number of payment periods in the investment or loan.
  - `pmt`: The payment made each period; it remains constant throughout the annuity. It typically includes principle and interest but excludes taxes, fees, and other additional charges.
  - `pv`: The present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now. For a loan, this would be the principle amount.
  - `fv`(*optional*): The future value or the cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If omitted, it defaults to 0, meaning the loan is fully paid off.
  - `type`(*optional*): Specifies when payments are due. `0` indicates payments are due at the end of the period, and `1` indicates payments are due at the beginning. If omitted, it defaults to 0.  
  - `guess`(*optional*): You guess for what the rate will be. If omitted, Excel uses 10% as the default guess. This parameter is useful when the function is trying to converge an solution.

  **Example**: Suppose you have a loan of $10,000 that you need to repay over 5 years with monthly payments of $200, and you want to find to find out the interest rate.

  ```
  =RATE(5*12, -200, 10000)*12
  ```

  - `nper`: 5 years multiplied by 12 to get the total number of monthly periods (60).
  - `pmt`: -200 (negative because it represents outgoing payments).  - `pv`: 10000 (the loan amount).
  - `fv`: Omitted, assuming the loan is fully paid off at the end.
  - `type`: Omitted, assuming payments are made at the end of each period.
  - `guess`: Omitted, so Excel uses the default guess of 10%.

The `RATE()` function will return the monthly interest rate. Multiplying by 12 converts this monthly rate to annual rate.

**Key Points**:
  - The **RATE()** function is used to find the interest rate when the payment amount, number of periods, and present value are know. 
  - The rate returned is per period(e.g., per month for monthly payments), so if you need an annual rate, you should multiply by the number of periods per year.
  - This function is helpful in financial planning, such as determining loan rates, saving rates, and investment returns.

The `RATE()` function is a powerful tool for analyzing loans, mortgages, and investments, allowing you to uncover the interest rate when other details of the financial arrangement are know.


### 5. PMT

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **PMT**     | Calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a <br />constant interest rate.    | =PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])  |


### 6. NPER

| Function    | Description                                              | Syntax              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **NPER**    | Returns the number of periods for a investment based on periodic, <br />constant payments and a constant interest rate.   | =NPER(rate,pmt,pv,[fv],[type])   |
